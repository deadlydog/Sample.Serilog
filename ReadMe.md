# Serilog Samples

This repo contains a solution with a number of projects showing how to configure [Serilog](https://serilog.net) in them.

## Writing logs

Serilog works like most other logging frameworks, with one extra feature that it can serialize objects and display their public properties; private properties and public/private fields are not serialized and written to the log though.

There are a couple things to keep in mind:

1. If you want an object to be serialized so that it's public properties are written (rather than `ToString()` being called on the instance itself), prefix the name with `@` or `$`.
1. Do not use string interpolation (i.e. `Log.Debug($"The time is {DateTime.Now}."`) or manual string concatenation (i.e. `Log.Debug("The time is " + DateTime.Now)`) as it can severely hurt performance.
Always use a template string and pass the variables in the params parameter (e.g. `Log.Debug("The time is {Now}", DateTime.Now)`)

Here's an example of the various log levels and how you can log primitives and objects.

```csharp
var structuredData = new StructuredData();
var simpleData = "This is a string.";

Log.Verbose("Here's a Verbose message.");
Log.Debug("Here's a Debug message. Only Public Properties (not fields) are shown on structured data. Structured data: {@sampleData}. Simple data: {simpleData}.", structuredData, simpleData);
Log.Information(new Exception("Exceptions can be put on all log levels"), "Here's an Info message.");
Log.Warning("Here's a Warning message.");
Log.Error(new Exception("This is an exception."), "Here's an Error message.");
Log.Fatal("Here's a Fatal message.");
```

For more information, see the [official docs](https://github.com/serilog/serilog/wiki/Writing-Log-Events).

## NuGet packages required

To be able to define the Serilog configuration in a json file, rather than hard-coding it, use:

- Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json (to read from appsettings.json file)
- [Serilog.Settings.Configuration](https://github.com/serilog/serilog-settings-configuration) (to read from Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration)

Then add NuGet packages for whatever sinks you want to use:

- [Serilog.Sinks.Async](https://github.com/serilog/serilog-sinks-async) (use to log to other sinks asynchronously to improve performance)
- [Serilog.Sinks.Console](https://github.com/serilog/serilog-sinks-console) (to write to the console)
- [Serilog.Sinks.File](https://github.com/serilog/serilog-sinks-file) (to write to a file (supports rolling files))

__NOTE:__ If you forget to add the sinks NuGet packages, no logs will be written to any sinks.

### Enricher to automatically attach additional data to log entries

The `Enrichers` NuGet packages are optional and only required if you want to automatically enrich _all_ of your log entries with additional data.

- [Serilog.Enrichers.AspNetCoreHttpContext](https://github.com/trenoncourt/serilog-enrichers-aspnetcore-httpcontext) (for logging request data)
- [Serilog.Enrichers.Context](https://github.com/saleem-mirza/serilog-enrichers-context) (for Environmental variables)
- [Serilog.Enrichers.Environment](https://github.com/serilog/serilog-enrichers-environment) (for Machine or User name)
- [Serilog.Enrichers.Memory](https://github.com/JoshSchreuder/serilog-enrichers-memory) (for memory consumption)
- [Serilog.Enrichers.Process](https://github.com/serilog/serilog-enrichers-process) (for process ID and Name)
- [Serilog.Enrichers.Thread](https://github.com/serilog/serilog-enrichers-thread) (for Thread ID and Name)
- [Serilog.Exceptions](https://github.com/RehanSaeed/Serilog.Exceptions) (exception details)

There are many other Enricher NuGet packages for all sorts of things.

You can use the `LogContext` Enricher to attach custom properties to your logs, but it requires [code changes](https://github.com/serilog/serilog/wiki/Enrichment) to define what you want to attach.
An example might be to include a custom TransactionId property to link all logs from a specific transaction.

There's also packages like [Serilog.AspNetCore](https://github.com/serilog/serilog-aspnetcore) that can automatically attach web request IDs and other things to your logs.

__Note:__ Not all sinks show enricher properties by default. See the `Logging additional details` section below.

## Configuration

### Keep config in a file instead of code

It's best practice to configure your logging in a separate file, rather than directly in code, so for all of the samples the configuration is set in the `appsettings.json` file.

__Note:__ You must set the file property `Copy to Output Directory` to `Copy if newer` so that it gets copied to the app's bin directory and can be read by the app.

### Logging additional details

The `Enrich` and `Properties` sections are pretty much the same; just the `Enrich` ones are out-of-the-box properties provided by the optional NuGet packages.

Some sinks do not display Properties (used by Enrichers) by default, such as the `Console` sink, and require you to explicitly define the output template and include `Properties`.
e.g. the `{Properties:j}` in:

```json
"WriteTo": [
    {
        "Name": "Console",
        "Args": {
            "theme": "Serilog.Sinks.SystemConsole.Themes.AnsiConsoleTheme::Code, Serilog.Sinks.Console",
            "outputTemplate": "[{Timestamp:HH:mm:ss} {Level:u3}] {Message:lj} <s:{SourceContext}>{NewLine}{Exception} {Properties:j}{NewLine}"
        }
    }
],
```

### Formatting the log output

[See the docs](https://github.com/serilog/serilog/wiki/Formatting-Output#formatting-plain-text) for more information on configuring the `outputTemplate`.

### File sync configuration

When using `"rollingInterval": "Day"` the date will automatically be appended to the file name.

### Json configuration example

```json
{
    "Serilog": {
        "MinimumLevel": "Verbose",
        "WriteTo": [
            {
                "Name": "Console",
                "Args": {
                    "theme": "Serilog.Sinks.SystemConsole.Themes.AnsiConsoleTheme::Code, Serilog.Sinks.Console",
                    "outputTemplate": "{Timestamp:yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.fff zzz} [{Level:u3}] {Message:j}{NewLine}{Properties:j}{NewLine}{Exception}"
                }
            },
            {
                "Name": "File",
                "Args": {
                    "restrictedToMinimumLevel": "Warning",
                    "path": "Logs\\log.txt",
                    "rollingInterval": "Day",
                    "fileSizeLimitBytes": 10240,
                    "rollOnFileSizeLimit": true,
                    "retainedFileCountLimit": 30
                }
            }
        ],
        "Enrich": [ "FromLogContext", "WithMachineName", "WithExceptionDetails" ],
        "Properties": {
            "ApplicationName": "SampleApp",
            "Environment": "Int"
        }
    }
}
```

Logging synchronously can slow down your application, especially logging to the console, so you'll typically want to enable asynchronous logging by using the `Async` sink and providing the other sinks in it's `Args`, like so:

```json
{
    "Serilog": {
        "MinimumLevel": "Verbose",
        "WriteTo": [
            {
                "Name": "Async",
                "Args": {
                    "configure": [
                        {
                            "Name": "Console",
                            "Args": {
                                "theme": "Serilog.Sinks.SystemConsole.Themes.AnsiConsoleTheme::Code, Serilog.Sinks.Console",
                                "outputTemplate": "{Timestamp:yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.fff zzz} [{Level:u3}] {Message:j}{NewLine}{Properties:j}{NewLine}{Exception}"
                            }
                        },
                        {
                            "Name": "File",
                            "Args": {
                                "restrictedToMinimumLevel": "Warning",
                                "path": "Logs\\log.txt",
                                "rollingInterval": "Day",
                                "fileSizeLimitBytes": 10240,
                                "rollOnFileSizeLimit": true,
                                "retainedFileCountLimit": 30
                            }
                        }
                    ]
                }
            }
        ],
        "Enrich": [ "FromLogContext", "WithMachineName", "WithExceptionDetails" ],
        "Properties": {
            "ApplicationName": "SampleApp",
            "Environment": "Int"
        }
    }
}
```

### Logging levels

As [defined in the config docs](https://github.com/serilog/serilog/wiki/Configuration-Basics#minimum-level), the logging levels are defined as:

- Verbose
- Debug
- Information
- Warning
- Error
- Fatal

__NOTE:__ While the levels logged can vary per sink via the `restrictedToMinimumLevel` property, the `MinimumLevel` property defines the absolute minimum level logged. So if the `MinimumLevel` was set to `Warning`, sinks could never log `Information`, `Debug`, or `Verbose` logs.

## Projects in the solution and what they show

### AspNet6 project

This one also requires adding the `Serilog.AspNetCore` NuGet package.
Using this package will automatically log additional ASP.Net information, such as information about every request that is made.

Files of interest:

- [Program.cs](/src/AspNet6/Program.cs) shows how to setup the global static Serilog logger and inject it into web host, as well as creating a bootstrap logger for logging messages during initialization.
- [Pages\Index.cshtml.cs](/src/AspNet6/Pages/Index.cshtml.cs) shows how to bring an instance of the logger into your class via constructor dependency inject, and then use it to write logs.
- [appsettings.json](/src/AspNet6/appsettings.json) shows how to configure Serilog, including specifying different minimum log levels for Microsoft, Microsoft.AspNetCore, and System messages.

### ConsoleAppNetCore3 project

Shows how to use native Serilog without any abstractions to log to the console and file.
For best practice you shouldn't reference the `Serilog.Log` static class in all of your classes like shown in this example.
A better alternative would be to inject an abstracted log interface instance into the class using dependency injection, or creating a new static class with similar logging methods and have only that class reference `Serilog.Log`.
That way you can more easily swap out logging frameworks later if needed.

Files of interest:

- [Program.cs](/src/ConsoleAppNetCore3/Program.cs) shows how to setup the global static Serilog logger in your app.
- [ClassThatLogs.cs](/src/ConsoleAppNetCore3/ClassThatLogs.cs) shows how to use the global static Serilog logger.
- [appsettings.json](/src/ConsoleAppNetCore3/appsettings.json) shows how to configure Serilog.

### AspNetCore3 project

This one also requires adding the `Serilog.AspNetCore` NuGet package.
Using this package will automatically log additional ASP.Net information, such as information about every request that is made.

Files of interest:

- [Program.cs](/src/AspNetCore3/Program.cs) shows how to setup the global static Serilog logger and inject it into web host.
- [Pages\Index.cshtml.cs](/src/AspNetCore3/Pages/Index.cshtml.cs) shows how to bring an instance of the logger into your class via constructor dependency inject, and then use it to write logs.
- [appsettings.json](/src/AspNetCore3/appsettings.json) shows how to configure Serilog.

### ConsoleAppNetCore3UsingMsLoggingAbstraction

This one also required adding the [`Serilog.Extensions.Logging`](https://github.com/serilog/serilog-extensions-logging), `Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting`, and `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection` NuGet packages.

This project uses the Microsoft dependency injection and logging abstractions to inject an `ILogger<T>` into the class that will write the logs.
This is a more proper way to make a console app than the `ConsoleAppNetCore3` project.

Files of interest:

- [Program.cs](/src/ConsoleAppNetCore3UsingMsLoggingAbstraction/Program.cs) shows how to set the global static Serilog logger and inject it into a host so that it can be used by dependency injection.
It also shows how to have the host run as a console application, and how you instruct it which class should be ran; in this example it is `TheApp` class.
- [ClassThatLogs.cs](/src/ConsoleAppNetCore3UsingMsLoggingAbstraction/ClassThatLogs.cs) shows how to bring an instance of the logger into your class via constructor dependency injection, and then use it to write logs.
- [TheApp.cs](src/ConsoleAppNetCore3UsingMsLoggingAbstraction/TheApp.cs) shows how to create the "entry point" of your app by having it implement `Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.IHostedService`, which gets ran by the Host created in `Program.cs`.
